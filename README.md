## Arcade Machine

For our semester project in Elements Of Computer Programming I @ Delaware State University in Fall 2018, we used the Design Thinking principles in order to make a challenge for a Childhood Memories themed escape room. 
The final result ended up being a Arcade Machine that would require you to enter a combination of numbers from completing the previous problem in order to access the challenge. If you enter the right combination of numbers, the rules of the challenge pop up. Complete the challenge and the key to escape the room will drop.

The entire project consisted of these students: Justin Bennett(Freshman), Boaz Menard(Junior), Juliana Paul(Freshman), Eunice Sanvee(Freshman), and Taia Williams-Rivera(Freshman).
